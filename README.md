# Obsidian Research MCP

A **reliable** Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Obsidian vaults. This system enables Claude to read, write, and search your Obsidian notes through the Local REST API plugin.

## üåü Features

### Core Capabilities ‚úÖ
- **Note Reading**: Read individual notes with full content and metadata
- **Note Writing**: Create and update notes in your vault
- **File Listing**: Browse your vault structure and find files
- **Content Search**: Search through note contents with context
- **Local REST API Integration**: Direct communication with Obsidian

### Architecture
- **Simple MCP Server**: Lightweight implementation with hard-coded configuration for testing
- **Obsidian Plugin**: Bridge between Local REST API and MCP server with auto-configuration
- **Reliable Communication**: HTTPS with SSL bypass for Local REST API compatibility

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js 18+**
- **Obsidian** with **Local REST API plugin** installed and running
- **Smart Connections plugin**

### Step 1: Install Local REST API Plugin

1. Open Obsidian Settings ‚Üí Community Plugins
2. Search for "Local REST API" 
3. Install and enable the plugin
4. In Local REST API settings:
   - Enable the server (it should start on port 27124)
   - Note down the API key generated
   - Ensure HTTPS is enabled

### Step 2: Build and Install MCP Components

1. **Clone and build the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/obsidian-research-mcp.git
   cd obsidian-research-mcp
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Install the Obsidian plugin**
   ```bash
   # Copy the built plugin to your vault
   cp -r packages/obsidian-plugin/ /path/to/your/vault/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-research-mcp/
   ```

3. **Enable the Research MCP Bridge plugin in Obsidian**
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Community Plugins
   - Enable "Research MCP Bridge"
   - The plugin will automatically detect your Local REST API key

### Step 3: Configure Claude Desktop

1. **Use the plugin's auto-configuration**
   - In Obsidian, run the command: "Configure Claude Desktop"
   - Copy the generated configuration

2. **Add to your Claude Desktop config**
   
   **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "obsidian-research-mcp": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/path/to/obsidian-research-mcp/packages/mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
         "env": {
           "OBSIDIAN_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here",
           "OBSIDIAN_API_URL": "https://127.0.0.1:27124",
           "OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH": "/path/to/your/vault"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Restart Claude Desktop**

### Step 4: Test the Connection

Ask Claude: **"Can you read my Obsidian notes?"**

Claude should respond with access to your vault and be able to:
- List files in your vault
- Read specific notes
- Create new notes
- Search through your content

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

The MCP server uses these environment variables (configured automatically by the plugin):

```bash
# Required

OBSIDIAN_API_URL=https://127.0.0.1:27124    # Local REST API endpoint  
OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH=/path/to/your/vault     # Your vault's path

# Optional
LOG_LEVEL=info                               # Logging verbosity
```

### Key Components

1. **MCP Server** (`packages/mcp-server/src/`)
   - Environment-based configuration with sensible defaults
   - Direct HTTPS communication with Local REST API
   - SSL certificate bypass for self-signed certificates
   - Comprehensive tool implementations across multiple feature domains

2. **Obsidian Plugin** (`packages/obsidian-plugin/main.ts`)
   - Auto-detects Local REST API plugin and key
   - Provides configuration commands
   - Generates Claude Desktop configuration
   - Bridge between Obsidian and external MCP server

3. **Local REST API Integration**
   - Uses HTTPS on port 27124 (correct Local REST API port)
   - Handles authentication with Bearer tokens
   - Supports file operations and content search

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Could not connect to Obsidian"**
- Ensure Local REST API plugin is installed and enabled
- Check that the server is running on port 27124
- Verify the API key in plugin settings

**"MCP server not responding"**
- Restart Claude Desktop after configuration changes
- First startup may take 15-30 seconds - wait for initialization
- Check that the MCP server path in config is correct
- Verify environment variables are set properly

**"Server startup timeout"**
- Wait for initialization to complete (usually under 30 seconds)
- Ensure no CPU-intensive processes are running during startup
- Check Claude Desktop logs for specific error messages

**"Permission denied"**
- Ensure Obsidian vault path is correct and accessible
- Check file permissions on the vault directory

### Debug Commands

Use the Obsidian plugin commands to diagnose issues:
- "Check MCP Dependencies" - Verify plugin status
- "Show Vault Information" - Check vault accessibility
- "MCP Integration Guide" - View current configuration status

## üîó Link Management

The system provides link updating capabilities when files are moved or renamed using the `obsidian_batch` tool with operation="update-links":

### Safe File Renaming/Moving
When using `obsidian_batch` for link updates, the system:

- **Moves files** from old path to new path
- **Updates backlinks** in other files that reference the moved file
- **Handles multiple link formats**:
  - Simple wikilinks: `[[OldFile]]` ‚Üí `[[NewFile]]`
  - Wikilinks with aliases: `[[OldFile|Custom Text]]` ‚Üí `[[NewFile|Custom Text]]`
  - Full path wikilinks: `[[folder/OldFile]]` ‚Üí `[[folder/NewFile]]`
  - Markdown links: `[text](OldFile.md)` ‚Üí `[text](NewFile.md)`
  - Embed links: `![[OldFile]]` ‚Üí `![[NewFile]]`

### Safety Features
- **Detailed logging** of all link updates performed
- **Error handling** that doesn't break file operations if link updates fail
- **Automatic backlink detection** and updating

This ensures that when you rename or move notes, your vault maintains link integrity without manual intervention.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

- API communication uses HTTPS with the Local REST API
- API keys are automatically managed by the Local REST API plugin
- No external network access required - all communication is localhost
- Vault access is controlled by Obsidian's file permissions
